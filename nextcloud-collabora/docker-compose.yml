# If collabora starts up with the other services,
# nextcloud database setup fails. But it works
# to start app and its dependencies first, then
# start collabora.
# Probably move collabora into its own docker-compose
# project, which kind of makes sense anyway since it
# will have its own traefik rules and exposure.
# Using wait-for-it seems to address the problem.
# collabora may be a red herring. I think the problem
# is a race condition when using environment variables
# to set up the database. Adding wait-for-it to nextcloud
# service seems to solve the problem, even when
# collabora is started at the same time.
